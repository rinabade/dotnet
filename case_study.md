# Case Study Questions:


You are a Chief Technology Officer of a Multi-National Company. The technical team seek your guidance for the choice of framework to create native mobile and desktop app. The team has a strong expertise of C# and .Net framework. But the team is not large enough to handle your diverse requirement, i.e. you seek them to develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single code-base. Therefore, the technical team seek your guidance to the question of the choice of framework.



### 1. What framework would you suggest for the development of Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows applications, and why? Justify with necessary diagrams. [10 marks]

Ans :-
 
As a chief technology officer of a MNC, for the above stated scenario going throughly through it, i would suggest to use the .NET's MAUI UI for the development of Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows applications.   
.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML.
Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared code-base. .NET MAUI unifies Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows APIs into a single API that allows a write-once run-anywhere developer experience, while additionally providing deep access to every aspect of each native platform.                              
As the BCL enables apps running on different platforms to share common business logic, the various platforms have different ways of defining the user interface for an app, and they provide varying models for specifying how the elements of a user interface communicate and interoperate.

.NET MAUI also provides:
* An elaborate layout engine for designing pages.
* Multiple page types for creating rich navigation types, like drawers.
* Support for data-binding, for more elegant and maintainable development patterns.
* The ability to customize handlers to enhance the way in which UI elements are presented.
* Cross-platform APIs for accessing native device features. These APIs enable apps to access device features such as the GPS, the accelerometer, and battery and network states. For more information, see Cross-platform APIs for device features.
* Cross-platform graphics functionality, that provides a drawing canvas that supports drawing and painting shapes and images, compositing operations, and graphical object transforms.
* A single project system that uses multi-targeting to target Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. For more information, see .NET MAUI Single project.
* .NET hot reload, so that you can modify both your XAML and your managed source code while the app is running, then observe the result of your modifications without rebuilding the app. For more information, see .NET hot reload.

### 2. If you add a requirement for Web application along with Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows applications, what changes are required to your framework? Justify your choice. [10 marks]

Ans:-

.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is a cross-platform framework for building applications for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. If you want to add a requirement for a web application in addition to these platforms, you would need to modify the framework to support web application development.
To do this, you would need to add support for web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the framework. You might also need to add support for web-specific features and APIs, such as web sockets and server-side rendering.
